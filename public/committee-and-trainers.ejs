        <h2>Volunteering</h2>
        <p>Our club is made up of volunteers of parents and members of the wider
            community. Our club would not survive without voulunteers giving up
            their time every week, to help with training, on the committee,
            fundraising, making tea and coffee on blitz days, match day officials
            and much more. We are so grateful to all who have given up their time
            to the club so far.
        </p>
        <p> We also always welcome new volunteers to the club.
            if you can only spare an hour every year or an hour a week any help is
            much appreciated.
        </p>
        <p> Please contact our chairman Kevin Cunningham on
